2. Use the browser developer tools to inspect elements, view console logs, and debug JavaScript code.
3. Use breakpoints in your code to pause execution and inspect variables.
4. Use the Angular CLI to run the project in development mode and view error messages in the console.
5. Use the Postman tool to test APIs and view response data.
6. Use the VS Code debugger to step through your code and inspect variables.
7. Use the Firebase CLI to view logs and debug cloud functions.

## 1.7. Codebase Structure and Flow

### 1.7.1. Overview of the Codebase

The codebase is organized into the following directories:

- `src` - Contains the source code for the Angular frontend application.
- `src/app` - Contains the Angular components, services, and modules.
- `src/assets` - Contains static assets like images, fonts, and stylesheets.
- `src/api` - Contains API endpoints and services for interacting with the backend.

### 1.7.2. Code Execution Flow

The code execution flow follows these steps:

1. The user interacts with the frontend application by browsing menus, selecting items, and placing orders.
2. The frontend application makes API calls to the backend to fetch data, submit orders, and track order status.
3. The backend application processes API requests, interacts with the database, and sends responses back to the frontend.
4. The database stores user data, restaurant data, order data, and other information needed by the application.
5. The payment gateway processes payment transactions and sends payment status updates to the backend.
6. The messaging service sends order updates and notifications to users via WhatsApp.
7. The application logic handles user authentication, authorization, and business logic for order processing.
8. The frontend application displays order status, menus, and other information to the user.
9. The backend application handles API requests, database queries, and external service integrations.
10. The database stores and retrieves data needed by the application.
11. The payment gateway processes payment transactions and sends payment status updates.
12. The messaging service sends order updates and notifications to users.
13. The application logic handles user authentication, authorization, and business logic.
14. The frontend application displays order status, menus, and other information.
